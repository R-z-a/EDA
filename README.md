# EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an integral part of the data science process. It involves examining and visualizing datasets to understand their characteristics, detect patterns, identify relationships between variables, and uncover insights that can inform subsequent analysis and decision-making. EDA is typically performed in the initial stages of a data science project to gain a deeper understanding of the data before applying more advanced techniques such as machine learning or statistical modeling.

EDA serves as a critical first step in the data analysis process, providing insights and guiding subsequent steps such as feature engineering, model selection, and hypothesis testing. It helps in extracting meaningful information from data and making informed decisions based on empirical evidence.
